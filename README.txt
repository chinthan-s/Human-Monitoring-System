The project "Human Monitoring System For Security Services Using Deep Learning" is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at leveraging Python and OpenCV to create a robust platform for real-time facial recognition. It stands as a testament to modern security practices, prioritizing the swift detection of unknown individuals to bolster security protocols. By integrating sophisticated algorithms and automation, the system ensures rapid response times through instant alerts and notifications. Its implementation marks a significant step forward in security technology, offering a proactive approach to safeguarding assets and individuals. Through continuous monitoring and advanced facial recognition capabilities, the project sets a new standard for security services, emphasizing efficiency, reliability, and user safety


HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

-Create a folder Face recognition system
-Inside the main folder create two folders- image-dataset and screenshots (two separate folders)
-After downloading the code add the code to the main folder.
-Store the known person images in the image-dataset folder.
-When a unknown person detected it will capture the image and save it in the screenshot folder.
